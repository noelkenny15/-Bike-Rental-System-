# -Bike-Rental-System-
## Introduction:
A Bike Rental Business System rents out bikes for short periods of time. Most rentals are
provided by bike shops as a side-line to their main businesses of sales and service, but some shops
specialize in rentals. As with Car Rental, bike rental shops primarily serve people who do not have
access to a vehicle, typically traveller and particularly tourists. Specialized bike rental shops
therefore typically operate at beaches, parks, or other locations that tourists frequent. In this case,
the fees are set to encourage renting the bikes for a few hours at a time, rarely more than a day.
Other bike rental shops rent by the day or week as well as by the hour, and these provide an
excellent opportunity for those who would like to avoid shipping their own bikes, but would like
to do a multi-day bike tour of a particular area. Using this system vehicle owner can register as
sellers and customers who want to take bikes on rent can register themselves as renters and can
take any bike on rent. Address of the both are required as the customer can only take bike by going
to the address provided and the vehicle owners can know the address that a customer is verified or
not. The customer also has to upload some proofs to take the bike on rent. Proofs like License,
Aadhar card are compulsory so that no one could run taking the bike. Any customer whose
proofs are not uploaded and are not valid will not be allowed to take any bikeon rent. This has one
admin account who verifies the registering user and two types of the user account. One for bike
sellers and one for customers who take the bike on rent. This system has only one admin
account and cannot have more than one admin account. Admin can verify and register the user
who is registering. If the admin does not verify, the user cannot register. All other features are
explained further with details.
